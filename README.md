# MIT-Beaver-Works-2016

This repository contains several relevant scrips and a technical paper from MIT's Beave Works Summer Insitute, a free four week summer program for highly qualified computer science and engineering students. In this program, students programmed autonomous RACECARs. As the original repositories included a great deal of preloaded files for the RACECAR, this repository simply contains copies of scripts most relevant to both the program.
